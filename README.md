## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS position properties
- SASS preprocessor


### What I learned

I learned how to use the position properties of css to be able to overlay 2 images and show one image when the image below is hovered.
I also learned how to use the CSS SASS preprocessor.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn how to use position properties and css flexboxes to be able to make larger projects without any problems.
I will also continue to learn how to use preprocessors like SASS to write CSS code much faster and keep my CSS code clean and tidy.
